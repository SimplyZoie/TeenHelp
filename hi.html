      A MESSAGE FROM YOUR ADMINS!!
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
Thanks for joining Teen2Teen! Your admins greatly appreciate you for joining our growing family. So by now you probably want to know who your admins are, Right???
Meet your admins:

Hi! My name is Zoie and I am one of your admins. All of us admins met in a program called Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in the summer of 2017. If you want to learn more, search “Girls Who Code” on google.  This program lasted 7 weeks and on weeks 6-7, we had to complete a final project. So, your admins decided on this site, Teen2Teen. We want this website to give you courage and help you through any tough struggles you face along the way. The reason I wanted in on this project is because there needs to be a place where teens with tough problems can express it with like minded people. I knew that I could help make this project come to life by using my creativity and kindness. So, I collaborated with Lenie (one of your other admins) to help make her idea what you see today. My hope is that this site becomes something big and helps to save lives for thousands of teens. Enjoy the site!

Hi, my name is Yarlenie aka Lenie and i am one of the admins for our website Teen2Teen. Recently i attended a summer immersion program called Girls Who Code and the final two weeks was final project where we had to code something whether it was a website, game or write a code for a robot and i decided to build a website to help teens who struggle on a daily basis, that's what this website is for. Me and Zoie (a fellow admin) talked about it before it could even get approved by our teacher, that’s how passionate we were. As someone who struggled I feel as though that this would be a great thing for our community. I hope our website can expand & help teens all over the world, Something you say today can save a live tomorrow. I hope you enjoy

Howdy, fellow human, and welcome to Teen2Teen! My name is KfromWalgreens, but everyone calls me Kennedy for some reason. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I am the last admin of this swanky website. Like the others, I strongly believe that we teens deserve a safe space to express ourselves and receive messages of hope from our peers. Whether you’re here to vent your problems, participate in forum discussions, or are only here to browse, I hope that the content on this site will help change your life for the better. My thoughts and prayers go out to you! Please remember that things will get better… but until then, here’s a Lenny emoji (but this time he’s a pupper) : ( ͡° ᴥ ͡°)
